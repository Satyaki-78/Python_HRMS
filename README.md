## I am just a newbie to software development, criticize accordingly
- The name Sukriya_HRMS is there because I was developing this under the startup company Sukriya. They asked me later on to stop making this for them as they could'nt afford a custom made software. Ignore the name for now
- The [documentation](https://github.com/Satyaki-78/Python_HRMS/blob/main/Python_HRMS%20documentation.pdf) to the project. Not complete yet but enough for you to understand the project
- I have yet to add a virtual environment in the project
- Only the auth system is done. View the `auth_window.py` file to see it

## This might take me a year to properly complete the project. But I will finish it
